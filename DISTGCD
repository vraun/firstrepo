'''in this prblm {codechef : DISTGCD}, the number of factors for the difference of [a,b]
helps in finding the solution of the answer, to be much more clearer understanding
 for each differnt type of difference the no of factors for that diff is the solution .
 the solution has a time complexity, in order to over come the time complexity int(sqrt(r))
  is taken as range and as stated in line  8-9 if i**2 == r, then 1 is incremented, else
  for every i that is allowed c is incremented by 2.'''
